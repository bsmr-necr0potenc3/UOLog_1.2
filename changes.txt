This is the last UOLog 1.x version.
The next release will be completely rewritten, featuring a plugin engine and other things.

Release 1.2:

17 April 2004:
    -Added a new filter type: HexLex
     It is a regular expression engine which I coded for UOLog.
     You can enter filter strings like "BF ?? ?? ?? 06|07" to only log BF SubType 06 or 07.
     The syntax is easy, seperate each byte with a space. '|' is or. '?' is a wildcard for any nibble.
     ?? can be used as wildcard on any byte.
     Example:
     "02 ?2|?3" would only log walking requests for direction 02 or 03, running and walking.
     Note that invalid strings (spaces before or after | etc) might crash, I didn't want to debug it yet.
     Have fun with this new feature.

Release 1.1:

27 August 2003:
   -Added Logging -> Raw, handy if you want to paste the output directly into a script.
   -Fixed some minor typos in the tutorial.


Release 1.0:

03 August 2003:
   -Copying from the logwindow is not in unix format now.
   -The millisecond part of the timestamp is correct now.


Beta 9:

10 June 2003:
   -Fixed a bug where detaching would crash the client.
   -Compiled with Visual Studio .NET 2003, hope that doesn't break anything *ducks*.

Beta 8:

7 June 2003:
   -Q121093: Fixed a bug in the DebugLoop which made UOLog swallow a lot of packets. Now it's even working on RunUO.
   -Q108315: Added "Always on Top" option.
   -Q109550: Changed the PacketWindow's internal behaviour. It won't need memory anymore, that means it can hold
    an unlimited amount (Well, 4Gb) of text without lagging like older versions.
    I had 1Mb of text in the logwindow and it didn't lag, before it started to lag at 100kb.
    Unfortunately this broke AutoScrolling a bit, if you have the scrollbar at the bottom of the window,
    it will still autoscroll, regardless of the settings. But if you move the bar up one pixel, it won't scroll.
    I think that's better than a lagging logwindow.
   -Assertions now generate dumps, too. UOLog still didn't crash for me yet, after 6 months of using it.
   -Converted the whole project to pure C.
   -Added more packet names.

Beta 7:

5 June 2003:
   -*If* UOLog crashes, it will now generate CrashDumps (like POL's).
    Two crashdumps will be generated, a small and a big one.
    This feature requires DbgHelp.dll, included in Windows XP, versions
    for older Windows' are downloadble from Microsoft.com.
    If you can compress the big one to <=3Mb, please mail it to me.
    Else mail me the other one.
    Note that the big one might contain your account data (The big one
    sends UOLog's memory, which contains the LogWindow contents, which
    may contain your login packets).

   -Fixed a very stupid error which was introduced in Beta 5.
    The error was that the filter didn't work, resulting in no packets
    being logged. Heh.

Beta 6:

2 June 2003:
   -DeBPXs are no longer required! Thanks to DarkStorm for the idea with EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP.
   -Options are no longer saved automatically, they are saveable via Options->SaveOptions and
    automatically loaded at startup.

Beta 5:

8 Feb 2003:
   -Added automatic option saving and loading.

6 Feb 2003:
   -Internal code cleanup to prepare the open source release.

Beta 4:

4 Feb 2003:
   -Added Autoscrolling. Thanks to Arog <arog@elitecoder.net> for this feature.
   -Fixed a bug when UO runs on a different CPU (on dual CPU systems) than UOLog.
   -Fixed a major bug where UOLog would print random stuff into the packetlog if the
    packet contained a '%' char (Reason was using fprintf for printing to the log; now using
    fwrite).
   -The packet statistics are now printed into the log even if you close UOLog before closing the
    client.

Beta 3:

15 Jan 2003:
   -Added automatic log flushing.
   -Optimized GetPacketName.
   -Fixed log clearing.

Beta 2:

14 Jan 2003:
   -Fixed a bug in the BPX handling which made UOLog unable to use on Win98 / 2000.
   -Released.

10 Jan 2003:
   -Changed old 'logwindow' to a richedit wrapperclass. Still in development.

09 Jan 2003:
   -Improved my Breakpoint wrapperclass to be faster.

08 Jan 2003:
   -Major code cleanup, reduced size from 1200 lines of code to 800 lines of code.
   -Improved the performance.

07 Jan 2003:
   -Minor code cleanups. Should run more stable now (It never crashed for me yet).

06 Jan 2003:
   -Fixed a very small resource leak (Clienthandle not being CloseHandle()'d).
   -Added assertions to help detecting bugs.

05 Jan 2003:
   -Added validation of RecvBuffer and SendBuffer.
   -If you specify 32 bit registers for length,
    UOLog will use the 16 bit ones now. That is due to
    changes in newer clients. (Internally: 32 bit reg AND 0xFFFF)

Beta 1:

04 Jan 2003:
   -Initial release.
