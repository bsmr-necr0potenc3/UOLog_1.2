I tried to make the output of UOLog same as UOPro's.
Yet both tools have their advantages and disadvantages:

UOLog Advantages:
-In newer Windows versions you can start and stop UOLog anytime using attaching and detaching.
-Has a more efficient client identification technique, so it will work with modified clients too.
-Has a more customizable packet filter.
-Has a GUI (!).
-Internals are customizable via clients.cfg file
-Is publicly available.
-Doesn't need to know packetlengths.
-Has more powerful packet statistics

UOLog Disadvantages:
-Doesn't have "Autopilot mode" and will never have it (I don't like stuff like that).
