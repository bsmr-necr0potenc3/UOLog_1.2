      This tutorial will show you how to find the client's Encrypt and uncompress 
      routines. <br>
      The first part shows the difficult approach, it requires no knowledge about 
      the client's internals.<br>
      The second part is based on the first part and shows you how to find the 
      values for any client in a few seconds.<br>
      If you're new to reversing or just want to find the values quickly, skip 
      part 2 and move on to 3.

  <tr> 
    <td height="0"  class="Text" valign="top"> 
      <p class="MsoNormal">Ok, let's go. Open your client (Assuming 4.0.0l) in 
        IDA. Use default options and let IDA work. Eat some pasta in the meantime.<br>
        When IDA is done, save the database. We'll need it later, not now.<br>
        Now start any server emulator (My favourite is <a href="http://www.polserver.com">POL</a>) 
        and open your client (One *with* encryption!).<br>
        Next, open up OllyDbg and attach it to the client. Set a breakpoint on 
        &quot;send&quot;.<br>
        To do so, press ctrl+g and enter &quot;send&quot;. To set the actual breakpoint, 
        press F2.<br>
        Now enter any login and password and hit enter. Olly will break and popup.<br>
        In the calling stack window in Olly (lower right), you can see the stack 
        for send. &quot;DataSize&quot; is 0x3E, that's the correct length for 
        the login packet. But look at &quot;Data&quot;, it's encrypted, and that's 
        not how we want it in UOLog.<br>
        The TOS (Top of Stack) always shows the return address of a call, ie. 
        the location from where the call was made. Remove the breakpoint (F2) 
        and go to that location with ctrl+g (419A08 in 4.0.0l).<br>
        Ok, we're direct on the send call. The packets are encrypted there. 
        If you scroll up a bit, you'll see the message &quot;dunno, select with 
        invalid socket&quot;. Looks like we're in the client's send function. 
        Set a breakpoint on top of that function (419980) and login again to make 
        Olly break there.<br>
        When it breaks, you'll notice that the function has no calling stack, 
        ie. it's func(void);. Trace down using F8 and observe the register window. 
        You'll notice that 4199E6 ECX contains the length. The next line puts 
        the address of the encrypted send buffer into EDI.<br>
        We put our breakpoint too late, the data is encrypted there already.<br>
        Hmm, what can we do? Right! We put a breakpoint on the address of the 
        encrypted send buffer. Right click on the first byte of the encrypted 
        datastream in the dump window and select &quot;Breakpoint -&gt; Memory, 
        on access&quot;. Now resume the client. Olly will break immediately, you'll 
        see a rep stosd, that cleans up the memory by setting it to 00 00...Resume 
        the client, login again, and olly will break again.<br>
        Wow, this time we're in a loop (You'll recognize loops by black borders 
        around them in olly). The loop is using shr, shl and some other binary 
        operators. That really looks like the encryption loop, nice. Remove the 
        memory breakpoint, but don't resume the client yet.<br>
        Instead, place a breakpoint on top of the encrypt function (41A360) and 
        then resume the client.<br>
        Login again, and olly will break. Look at all the registers, EDX contains 
        the length already. But the data isn't in the registers yet, so let's 
        trace (F8) over the call which is right below the function header.<br>
        Look at the registers! Great! EAX contains the length and ESI contains 
        our packet! That's all we need for send.<br>
        We have:<br>
        Address where we have the plain packet: 41A370<br>
        Register with the length: EAX<br>
        Register with the packet: ESI<br>
        <br>
        Now for recv.<br>
        We can't use the crypt client anymore because the server doesn't send 
        back anything since our login packets aren't valid (Well, encrypted). 
        So let's fire up a no-crypt-client and attach Olly to it.<br>
        Login and go to a location without any NPCs and anything so you don't 
        receive any packets.<br>
        Remember that the client used &quot;select&quot; to check if there are 
        packets ready to be received? Let's set a breakpoint on select.<br>
        Of course Olly breaks immediately because the client constantly checks 
        for packets (Btw, that's one reason why it needs 100% CPU all the time, 
        but that's another story, PeekMessage). Go to the calling address (419803) and you'll 
        see the check if select returned -1.<br>
        Scroll down a bit and you'll see a call to recv inside a loop. If you 
        know how TCP/IP works then you know that the packets arrive as a stream, 
        not at once, that's why they're received in a loop. Place a break on top 
        of that loop (41985C) and resume the client.<br>
        It will break soon because it receives a ping reply packet. Go to the 
        location where Olly displays &quot;Buffer&quot;. That's where recv will 
        store the received data. Display it in the dump window, step over recv 
        and then set a memory breakpoint on it.<br>
        You'll notice that the memory just gets cleaned, so a memory on write 
        breakpoint isn't correct. Set a &quot;On access&quot; breakpoint instead.<br>
        If you did it right, you'll end up in some loop at 419BC0. Place a break 
        on top of that function.<br>
        When the client breaks, remove the breakpoint and go to the calling address 
        (419D0C). You will see a big loop below the call. Trace a bit into that 
        loop and you'll see that it builds the packet and calls 41A4A0 after building 
        the packet.<br>
        Trace into that function and look at the registers, EDI contains the length 
        and ESI contains the packet. Done.<br>
        Now we have all the information for recv:<br>
        Address where we have the plain packet: 41A4A0<br>
        Register with the length: EDI<br>
        Register with the packet: ESI<br>
        <br>
        Now all we have to do is getting the timestamp of the client. Open client.exe 
        in UltraEdit and search the PE header. It is on top of the file and starts 
        with &quot;PE&quot;, in 4.0.0l it's at 0x0138. Skip the next WORD and 
        the next DWORD and you'll have the TimeStamp in Little Endian. To convert 
        it to human readable Big Endian, reverse the bytes, resulting in 3EBFECC0.<br>
        That's it, we have all the required information for UOLog!<br>
