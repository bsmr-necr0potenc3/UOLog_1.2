Hi,

this is Folko writing, the author of UOLog. I didn't release the source code
of UOLog earlier because I had a fear that it might be used for purposes that
I do not support, e.g. cheating.
By now I am out of the whole UO scene and don't care anymore. I hope that
someone finds the sources useful. I didn't modify anything, just updated the
changes and added this file.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me:
